description: Build the Hyperspace Desktop apps from source.
product: Hyperspace Desktop
---

The Hyperspace Desktop source code also includes the necessary tools to start building the desktop app versions of Hyperspace using technologies like Electron. This document will cover how to get started building the desktop versions.

## Requirements

- Git
- Node.js 10 or higher
- (macOS only) Xcode 10 or higher

## Gather the source materials

To get started, either download the Hyperspace source code for the intended release (v1.x.x) or clone straight from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/hyperspacedev/hyperspace.git
```

Then, proceed to install the project's dependencies:

```
cd hyperspace
npm install
```

The project should now contain all of the necessary Node modules to build the desktop apps.

Make sure you set the `location` field in `public/config.json` to `"desktop"` before continuing.

## Build commands

You can run any of the following commands to build a release for the desktop:

- `npm run build:desktop-all`: Builds the desktop apps for all platforms (eg. Windows, macOS, Linux). Will run `npm run build` before building.
- `npm run build:win`: Builds the desktop app for Windows without running `npm run build`.
- `npm run build:mac`: Builds the desktop apps for macOS without running `npm run build`. See the details below for more information on building for macOS.
- `npm run build:mas`: Builds the desktop apps for the Mac App Store without running `npm run build`. See the details below for more information on building for macOS.
- `npm run build:linux`: Builds the desktop apps for Linux (eg. Debian package, AppImage, and Snap) without running `npm run build`.
- `npm run build:linux-select-targets`: Builds the desktop app for Linux without running `npm run build`. _Targets are required as parameters._

The built files will be available under `dist` that can be uploaded to your app distributor or website.

## Extra steps for macOS

The macOS builds of Hyperspace Desktop require a bit more effort and resources to build and distribute accordingly. The following is a quick guide to building Hyperspace Desktop for macOS and for the Mac App Store.

### Gather your tools

To create a code-signed and notarized version of Hyperspace Desktop, you'll need to acquire some provisioning profiles and certificates from a valid Apple Developer account.

For certificates, make sure your Mac has the following certificates installed:

- 3rd Party Mac Developer Application
- 3rd Party Mac Developer Installer
- Developer ID Application
- Developer ID Installer
- Mac Developer

The easiest way to handle this is by opening Xcode and going to **Preferences &rsaquo; Accounts** and create the certificates from "Manage Certificates".

You'll also need to [create a provisioning profile for **Mac App Store** distribution](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/profiles/add) and save it to the `desktop` folder as `embedded.provisonprofile`.

### Create your entitlements files

You'll also need to create the entitlements files in the `desktop` directory that declares the permissions for Hyperspace Desktop. Replace `TEAM_ID` with the appropriate Apple Developer information and `BUNDLE_ID` with the bundle ID of your app.

#### entitlements.mac.plist

```plist
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">

    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write</key>

  </dict>
</plist>
```

#### entitlements.mas.plist

```plist

	<true/>
	<key>com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write</key>
	<true/>

```

#### entitlements.mas.inherit.plist

```plist

```

```plist

<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">

	<key>com.apple.application-identifier</key>
	<string>TEAM_ID.BUNDLE_ID</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

### Edit `notarize.js`

You'll also need to edit `notarize.js` in the `desktop` directory. Replace `<TEAM_ID>`, `<BUNDLE_ID>`, and `<APPLE_DEVELOPER_EMAIL>` with the appropriate information from the app and your account from Apple Developer.

```js
// notarize.js
// Script to notarize Hyperspace for macOS
// Â© 2019 Hyperspace developers. Licensed under Apache 2.0.

const { notarize } = require("electron-notarize");

// This is pulled from the Apple Keychain. To set this up,
// follow the instructions provided here:
// https://github.com/electron/electron-notarize#safety-when-using-appleidpassword
const password = `@keychain:AC_PASSWORD`;

exports.default = async function notarizing(context) {
  const { electronPlatformName, appOutDir } = context;
  if (electronPlatformName !== "darwin") {
    return;
  }

  console.log("Notarizing Hyperspace...");

  const appName = context.packager.appInfo.productFilename;

  return await notarize({
    appBundleId: "<BUNDLE_ID>",
    appPath: `${appOutDir}/${appName}.app`,
    appleId: "<APPLE_DEVELOPER_EMAIL>",
    appleIdPassword: password,
    ascProvider: "<TEAM_ID>",
  });
};
```

Note that the password is pulled from your keychain. You'll need to create an app password and store it in your keychain as `AC_PASSWORD`.

### Build the apps

Run any of the following commands to build Hyperspace Desktop for the Mac:

- `npm run build:mac` - Builds the macOS app in a DMG container.
- `npm run build:mac-unsigned` - Similar to `build:mac`, but skips code signing and notarization. **Use only for CI or in situations where code signing and notarization is not available.**
- `npm run build:mas` - Builds the Mac App Store package.
