            <h1>A new design you'll absolutely love.</h1>
            <p>
                Hyperspace is beautifully designed to put your content front and center and bring a familiar experience to Mastodon. View threads and profiles with ease and compose anywhere with the compose button. And, of course, Hyperspace scales across devices beautifully, providing the same experience anywhere.

            <h1>Customization at every level.</h1>
            <p>
                Hyperspace allows customization and configuration at every level, from the server level with branding and instance setup, down to the user level with dark mode and custom themes. And, if the default configuration settings aren't enough, anyone can make their own version of Hyperspace with custom additions.
