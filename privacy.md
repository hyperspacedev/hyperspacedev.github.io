# Privacy Policy

This purpose of this privacy policy is to let users know what data is collected and how that data is used.

## What we collect (or rather, don't)

Any Hyperspace product from the Hyperspace team does _not_ collect data. We have no interest in collecting any data for the time being. However, any instance that is connected to any Hyperspace product may collect data and thus their privacy policy rules take effect.

## Why this is necessary

This policy has been written so that the Mac App Store page can link to this privacy policy.

## Contact
If you have any questions or concerns about this policy, email us at [hyperspacedev@marquiskurt.net](mailto:hyperspacedev@marquiskurt.net).
