Hello, everyone! I hope you've all been doing well the past few months. I wanted to provide an 
update as to what's been happening here at Hyperspace Project HQ.

## A commitment to ethical source

You may recall that we began [a discussion on GitHub][gh-discussion] in late Janurary regarding
our licensing for all of our projects, excluding Hyperspace Classic, after rising concerns with the
limitations the Non-Violent Public License imposes, notably the violation of the zeroth freedom in
the definition of open-source as defined by the Free Software Foundation and the Open Source
Initiative.

I'd like to reiterate a point that I addressed on the initial post to this discussion:

> It is without a doubt that the people that use Hyperspace Desktop as well as the team care very 
> deeply about open source and the world of free software. Providing open source software and 
> investing in that community provides great benefits in technology overall. It is also apparent 
> that we as a whole are concerned about the fediverse's health and issues surrounding free speech 
> and ethics, especially given the events that occurred on January 6, 2021. While we did not foresee
> those events, we wanted to pick a license that allowed the permissibility of open-source while
> also ensuring that the people who use, modify, and redistribute it do so in a manner that doesn't
> harm others or cause violence. Hence, we went with a license that is considered as ethical-source
> or ethical open-source. 

After months of discussion and careful consideration, we have decided that we will continue
licensing our projects, present and future, under the Non-violent Public License. We highly value
the safety of our users and will take steps necessary to ensure that we keep everyone safe, despite
the often-seemingly "hands off" approach that FOSS licenses usually take.

### What does this mean?

We understand that some users do not agree with our license of choice, especially due to concerns
with breaking the definition of open-source as stated by the Open Source Initiative and the Free
Software Foundation. You are free to not use our software if you do not agree to the license.
Additionally, you are more than welcome to create a fork of Hyperspace Desktop v1.0.0-beta6 (the
last beta before the license change) or the classic Desktop client, which is currently under the 
LGPL-3.0 license.

## Starlight, rebooted

**Codename Starlight** is our native fediverse client for macOS, iOS, and iPadOS. We outlined some
of the work we have done in our last post back in September, which included threads, the Explore
page, and the profile page. A lot has changed since then thanks to what was revealed at this year's
WWDC (2021).

### A cleaner, concurrent backend library that rocks üê§ üé∏

Swift 5.5 brings better concurrency to the table thanks to support for the `async` and `await`
keywords, as well as new `actors` and support for running code asynchronously, saving us the
trouble from "callback hell" or the "pyramid of doom". We were excited when the news came out and
knew we had to update our own networking code to fully embrace the best of concurrency.

Enter **Chica**, our new Swift package for making requests to Mastodon (and eventually, Twitter)
with concurrency in mind. Chica handles app creation and authentication via OAuth in a secure
manner, designed in a way that developers needn't worry about token management.

Requests are also just as easy to execute. Say, for instance, fetching the custom emojis from the
current user's Mastodon instance:

```swift
import Chica
let emojis: [Emoji]? = try await Chica.shared.request(.get, for: .customEmojis)

```

We also are including documentation build with DocC and plan to make a release of Chica when it's in
a suitable state.

### Starting from scratch

With Chica now taking place in Codename Starlight, we knew it was time to focus on redesigning the
Starlight project as a whole. We decided on the following tenets for designing Starlight:

- Creating an experience for *new and upcoming users* wanting to try Mastodon for any reason, 
  whether it be privacy or technology related or experiential;
- Providing flexibility with accounts by integrating with Twitter to ease onboarding and migration;
- Designing a great native app that scales across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS and shows what is capable 
  with SwiftUI and Swift 5.5.

These tenets, which we lovingly call the "Starlight manifesto", allows us to explore designs that
will make it easier for a new person to join in on the conversation. Because it's easier than ever
to develop with SwiftUI 3 and Chica, we've been working on the macOS and iOS/iPadOS clients side by
side.

You can take a look at some of the screenshots of our work here. Please note that these designs are
not final and may be updated in future iterations.

We can't wait to share with you what will happen with Starlight in the future!
