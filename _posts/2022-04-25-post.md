Hi everyone,

Sorry for the long silence since our last post. We have had a lot cooking in the last
few weeks that we are excited to share with you. As some of you have noticed,
last Friday we released 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT version of our Kotlin API wrapper for Mastodon
named Foxy.

We decided to create Foxy for 2 reasons:

1. We noticed there wasn't an already existing Kotlin wrapper for Mastodon.
2. We plan to use Foxy as our backend for another project we are working on codenamed
   Luna.

To get started with Foxy and to learn how it works, we highly recommend you checkout
our [GitHub](https://github.com/hyperspacedev/foxy) page.

## Looking into the future

As I've said couple of lines ago, we plan to use Foxy for our other project codenamed
Luna. Our plan for Luna is for it to replace Hyperspace Desktop and for it to be a
renovated and beautiful Mastodon desktop application made with JetBrain's Compose For
Desktop.

We intially wanted to write Foxy and Luna in C# and .NET, however, after conducting a
poll, most of our desktop users are on Linux and .NET's new UI framework, MAUI, does
not compile to Linux. Granted, we could have used something like Avalonia but we very
much would have preferred a Microsoft-built-solution. Therefore, we settled with
Kotlin and Compose For Desktop so that we can offer robust experience across macOS,
Windows, and Linux.
